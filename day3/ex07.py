'''Exercise 7: Treasure Map Coordinate Filter
Scenario: You have a list of coordinate pairs representing suspected treasure locations on a map: 
coords = [[12, 5], [-3, 14], [8, -2], [15, 9], [-5, -6]]. However, the treasure can only exist in 
the first quadrant of the map (where both the X coordinate and Y coordinate are strictly greater 
than zero (i.e., x > 0 and y > 0)). Write a program that uses a list comprehension to filter the 
list and print only the valid coordinates.

Hardcoded Input: coords = [[12, 5], [-3, 14], [8, -2], [15, 9], [-5, -6]]
Sample Output: [[12, 5], [15, 9]]'''

def treasure_map():
    coords = [[12, 5], [-3, 14], [8, -2], [15, 9], [-5, -6],[00.2,90]]
    for i in coords:
        if i[0]>0 and i[1]>1:
            print(i)
treasure_map()
